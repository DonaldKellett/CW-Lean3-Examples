# Sequences in topological spaces

In this file we define sequences in topological spaces and show how they are related to
filters and the topology. In particular, we
* associate a filter with a sequence and prove equivalence of convergence of the two,
* define the sequential closure of a set and prove that it's contained in the closure,
* define a type class "sequential_space" in which closure and sequential closure agree,
* define sequential continuity and show that it coincides with continuity in sequential spaces,
* provide an instance that shows that every first-countable (and in particular metric) space is a sequential space.

# TODO
* Sequential compactness should be handled here.
